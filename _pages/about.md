I'm an Applied Math and Computer Science student at Duke Kunshan University (GPA 3.91/4.0). I will be graduating in May 2026 and receive a BS from both Duke Kunshan and Duke University.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on generative modeling and computer vision. I’ve worked on physics-informed diffusion models for environmental science, collaborative perception for autonomous driving, and video generation with temporal-aware controls. See more on my [Research](/research/) page.

Hobbies
======
I like working out, so I like doing weight training, climbing, swimming, dancing, and badminton. I was a member of DKU’s varsity badminton team (women’s doubles) and competed in matches. I also play guitar.
