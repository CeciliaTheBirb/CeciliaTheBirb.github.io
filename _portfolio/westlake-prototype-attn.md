title: "Temporal-Aware Attention Control Prototype"
excerpt: "Training-free, time-agnostic cross-attention controls for multi-event video generation; mitigates identity drift and boundary flicker."
collection: portfolio
---

- Context: Westlake University AIGC Summer Research (Supervisor: Prof. Chi Zhang)
- Goal: Preserve identity and semantics across multiple sequential events in a single video generation.
- Method: Temporal-aware attention routing and schedule design without model fine-tuning.
