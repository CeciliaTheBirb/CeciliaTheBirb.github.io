- Timeline: May 2025 â€“ Present, Westlake University (Supervisor: Prof. Chi Zhang)
- Focus:
  - Temporal-aware, training-free multi-event video generation with time-agnostic cross-attention controls to reduce identity drift and event boundary flicker.
  - Region-constrained 2D personalization with subject-mask guided LoRA fine-tuning to prevent background leakage and concept blending.
  - Large-to-small object replacement video editing with late-step schedule and smoothed editing trajectories.
