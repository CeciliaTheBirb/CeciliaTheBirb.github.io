title: "FENSe: Feedback-Enabled Neighbor Selection for Collaborative Perception"
excerpt: "Plug-and-play neighbor filtering module for V2X collaborative perception; stronger accuracy–efficiency tradeoff at equal bandwidth. Under Review."
collection: portfolio

- Timeline: Jan 2025 – May 2025 (Undergraduate Signature Work at DKU; Supervisor: Prof. Peng Sun)
- Idea: Convert single-vehicle outputs into compact feedback signals; dynamic clustering and neighbor selection to transmit only informative features.
- Results: +4% accuracy at equal bandwidth with reduced edge-side compute. 
- Full paper will be released upon paper acceptance.
