- Timeline: Jan 2025 – May 2025 (Undergraduate Signature Work at DKU; Supervisor: Prof. Peng Sun)
- Idea: Convert single-vehicle outputs into compact feedback signals; dynamic clustering and neighbor selection to transmit only informative features.
- Results: +4% accuracy at equal bandwidth with reduced edge-side compute.
